**update 2023-03-12 -- I now keep the wallpapers in encrypted archives. the password is in the `pw` file.** if you don't know how to extract the archives, contact me and i'll help you out


hello!

these are the wallpapers i use.

### folder explanation

#### sources - the source files (GIMP .xcf) if i make a wallpaper and decide saving the project is a good idea

    - these aren't organized

#### bin - some scripts that make my wallpaper life easier

    - alacritty_xr_color_scheme - change alacritty colors based on xresources

    - fav - move wallpaper to favorites folder (requires full path used on `wallpaper`)

    - unfav - like the above, but opposite

    - wallpaper - changes the wallpaper and sets xresources and pywalfox and blah blah blah it does the things use it it's nice

#### wallpapers - the actual wallpapers

    - favorites - my personal favorites (all working with wal, good colorschemes)

    - minimal - minimal

    - geometric - geometric

    - keyborb - keyborb

    - keyborb/sus - copyfringe inrightment, not uploaded to github

    - miscdump - if i download wallpaper dumps, and haven't yet organized them (probably never will), this is where they go

    - firewatch - wallpapers from the video game firewatch

    - geometric/broken :( - pictures that wal doesn't like (minimal and miscdump still have some broken photos)
